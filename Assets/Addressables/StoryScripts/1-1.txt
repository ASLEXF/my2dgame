FADE IN:

INT. CLIFF - NIGHT

The hunter is sleeping on a tree's branches. Suddenly wolfs are howling. The sound spproaches.

HUNTER
Errrrrr...

HUNTER
Errr... Noisy...

(beastly panting)

HUNTER
Darn it! I just lost my last place to sleep.

The hunter awakes. Several fiery eyes are staring at the hunter. Following the moonlight, the saliva dripping from their mouths can be seen.

HUNTER
Didn't expect they'd come so close to the village.

The hunter jumps off the tree with lunar gleam holding in the hand.
