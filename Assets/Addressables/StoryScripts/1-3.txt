FADE IN:

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The hunter is sleeping out on the streets. And the villager chief finds him. The hunter wakes up.

MAYOR
You are a part of us. If you like, you can sleep in the house, on a bed. 

HUNTER
I'd rather to sleep in a tree. Besides, you won't refuse a voluntary night sentry, isn't it?

HUNTER
And the beasts move closer than ever before. You got to inform other people. 

MAYOR
Bad news! But I have good news for you.

MAYOR
A villager found a hut in the forest. Kind of dilapidated to live. But I believe you wouldn't mind.

HUNTER
I don't remember I have missed any place on patrol. I will go to check for that.

MAYOR
How about heading for it right now? 

MAYOR
Besides, if the beasts are close to here again, please drive out them. We will provide corresponding compensation.
