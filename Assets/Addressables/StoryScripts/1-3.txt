FADE IN:

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The hunter is sleeping out on the streets. And the villager chief finds him. The hunter wakes up.

VILLAGE CHIEF
You are a part of us. If you like, you can sleep in the house, on a bed. 

HUNTER
I'd rather to sleep in a tree. Besides, you won't refuse a voluntary night sentry, isn't it?

HUNTER
And the beasts move closer than ever before. You got to inform other people. 

VILLAGE CHIEF
A bad news! But I have a good news for you.

VILLAGE CHIEF
A villager found a hut in the forest. Kind of dilapidated to live. But I believe you wouldn't mind.

HUNTER
I don't remember I have missed someplace on patrol. I will go to check that.

VILLAGE CHIEF
How about heading for it right now? 

VILLAGE CHIEF
Besides, if the beasts are close to here again, please drive out them. We will provide corresponding compensation.
